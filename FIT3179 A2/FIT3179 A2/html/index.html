                    <p>
                        Queensland is home to the largest population of koalas in Australia. However, the koala population in Queensland has been rapidly declining due to a combination of habitat loss, urban development, climate change, and diseases. 
                        Car accidents and dog attacks also contribute to high mortality rates, especially in areas where urbanization has encroached on koala habitats.
                        Conservation efforts are underway to protect koalas in Queensland, including habitat restoration, the creation of wildlife corridors, stricter regulations on land clearing,
                        and medical treatment programs to combat diseases.

                        <br>
                        Both NGOs and government organisations, are working to preserve Queensland's koala populations
                        through research, community engagement, and rescue operations. Despite these efforts, the species remains vulnerable, and continued action is essential to ensure 
                        the survival of koalas in Queensland.
                        This data visualisation explores the current state of koalas in Queensland, the threats they face, and the conservation efforts being made to protect them.

                                In some cases, koalas are found in captivity in wildlife rescue centers, zoos, or rehabilitation facilities. 
                                These koalas may be rescued due to injury, disease, habitat destruction, or other threats. 
                                They are often brought into captivity for treatment and conservation efforts, with the aim of returning them to the wild when they are healthy.

                                Captive koalas are generally housed in wildlife sanctuaries, rehabilitation centers, or zoos in Queensland 
                                where they receive medical care, food, and shelter.

                                Koalas are arboreal (tree-dwelling) animals, meaning they spend most of their time in trees. 
                                They are primarily found in eucalyptus forests and woodlands throughout Queensland, where they are
                                well-adapted to live in the upper canopy.
                                Trees are a good source of food, shelter and safety for koalas to rest and sleep.

                                Koalas are not generally ground-dwelling animals, but they occasionally come down from trees to move between locations, 
                                typically to find new trees, mates, or water sources. They are very slow movers on the ground usually prefer to stay in 
                                trees to avoid predators and other threats.

                                Koalas are vulnerable to cars, predators, and habitat destruction when they are on the ground.
                                This is why habitat fragmentation (e.g., urban development) is such a threat to koalas.

                            While both maps show koalas in the same general geographic region in Queensland, the spread of sick koalas may be more centralized in areas 
                            closer to human activity (urban centers or roads). In this case, areas such as Brisbane and Gold Coast with a higher human population also sees higher spreads of sick koalas. 
                            Healthy koalas could be concentrated in more rural or forested areas, suggesting these locations are less impacted
                            by human-related risks.

                                Sickness and other health conditions are the some of the more common conditions affecting koalas, indicating that a high percentage of koalas are suffering from various illnesses.

                                This suggests a need for urgent medical intervention and conservation efforts to manage these health risks.

                                This highlight the human impact on koala populations, with many koalas suffering from these, possibly due to the dangers of urban environments and human-wildlife conflict.
                                Urbanization and road development are posing a significant threat to koala survival, especially as they try to navigate fragmented habitats.
                                Vehicle hits are a common cause of injury and death for koalas, particularly when they attempt to cross roads in human-inhabited areas.

                                The presence of wasted and orphaned koalas points to a broader problem, which may include poor nutrition or loss of access to adequate habitats and food sources.
                                Orphaned koalas represent a significant concern, as it indicates the loss of young koalas due to various reasons, including loss of their mothers.

                        The number of dead koalas sightings is relatively lower overall, but shows periodic increases. The decrease of live koala sightings in earlier months of the year could be related to the bushfire incidents which usually occur during summer (Loane, 2022). 
                        Since the status of koalas was changed from vulnerable to endangered in 2022, the the number of dead koala sightings remained consistently low compared to previous years.

                        <br>
                        Both live and dead sightings show peaks around certain months, suggesting potential external factors affecting koala health or behavior such as habitat changes, natural disasters or improvement in conservation efforts.

                            Rescue, rehabilitation, and release are essential to koala conservation efforts in Queensland. 
                            Koalas are vulnerable to threats like dog attacks, vehicle accidents, and diseases, and they rely 
                            on a network of dedicated volunteers who respond to community reports of koalas in need of help.

                            Koala rehabilitation begins with rescuing sick, injured, or orphaned koalas, a task typically 
                            carried out by trained and licensed volunteers with expertise in handling these animals.
                            After being rescued, the koalas are taken to a wildlife hospital, clinic, or rehabilitation center. 
                            There, veterinarians assess their condition, checking for injuries or illness, and determine whether 
                            the animals can be treated and eventually released back into their natural habitat (Queensland Government, 2023).

                            the five years. However,
                            a factor to consider is the magnitude of the organisation as some of them operate on a smaller scale, leading to an overall lower amount of sightings.

                            enhancing wildlife corridors, and improving koala health monitoring. 
                            The strategy also aims to engage communities and stakeholders in conservation efforts, 
                            emphasizing the need for long-term, coordinated action to secure a future for koalas.

                            The Queensland Government also aims to work with various partners, including local councils, conservation groups, 
                            and wildlife organizations, to develop an implementation plan for koala conservation. 
                            This plan will involve activities like citizen science, public awareness campaigns, and contributing data to koala mapping efforts. 
                            Communities can actively participate in these initiatives to support koala preservation, either individually, or as part of NGO efforts. (Queensland Government, 2020)
